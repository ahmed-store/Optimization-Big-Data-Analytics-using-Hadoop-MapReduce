# Optimization-Big-Data-Analytics-using-Hadoop-MapReduce
The project aims to implement and optimize Big Data Analytics on sales data using Hadoop MapReduce combiners. It will focus on MapReduce Combiners implementation, comparing their performance against basic MapReduce (without Combiners), in-mapper combining, and a hybrid approach (in-mapper + Combiner + Reducer).
