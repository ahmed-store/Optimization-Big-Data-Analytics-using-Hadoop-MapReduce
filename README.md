# Implementation and Optimization of Big Data Analytics <br /> (on Sales Data) using MapReduce Combiners
## Overview
The project aims to implement and optimize Big Data Analytics on sales data using Hadoop MapReduce combiners. It will focus on MapReduce Combiners implementation, comparing their performance against basic MapReduce (without Combiners), in-mapper combining, and a hybrid approach (in-mapper + Combiner + Reducer). Hadoop MapReduce, a powerful framework for processing large datasets, will be employed to efficiently handle the data.
So, the primary goal of this project is to enhance the efficiency of the analysis process by leveraging the power of Hadoop MapReduce and its combiner optimization technique.

## Introduction 
In case of big data, volume, variety and velocity are the three main drivers that gave a new dimension to the way analytics had to be performed. For instance, in Walmart, data collected cross the Internet every hour from its customer transactions is in the range of petabytes. The speed in which data is created is more important than the volume. Big data takes the form of messages and images posted to social networks; readings from sensors; GPS signals from cell phones; and more. There is huge volume and variety of information available from social networks, namely Facebook and X platform. Mobile devices provide streams of data related to people, activities and locations. All the above said data are unstructured and so cannot be stored in structured databases.
